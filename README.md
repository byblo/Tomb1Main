# Tomb Raider I: Community Edition

This is an open source implementation of the classic Tomb Raider I game (1996),
made by reverse engineering the TombATI / GLRage variant of the original game
and replacing proprietary audio/video libraries with open source variants.

See the [Tomb Raider Forums
topic](https://www.tombraiderforums.com/showthread.php?p=8286101).

This project was inspired by Arsunt's
[TR2Main](https://github.com/Arsunt/TR2Main/) project and the legacy name,
"Tomb1Main", reflects that.

## Installing (simplified)

1. Head over to GitHub releases: https://github.com/rr-/Tomb1Main/releases
2. Download the installer. Your browser may complain that the .exe is unsafe, but it's OK to ignore this alert.
3. Mark the installer EXE as safe to run by right-clicking on the .exe, going to properties and clicking "Unblock".
4. Run the installer and proceed with the steps.

We hope that eventually these alerts will go away as the popularity of the project rises.

## Installing (advanced / manual)

1. Head over to GitHub releases: https://github.com/rr-/Tomb1Main/releases
2. Download the zip file.
3. Extract the zip file into a directory of your choice.  
   Make sure you choose to overwrite existing directories and files
   (`cfg/Tomb1Main_config.json5` can remain, but new features will not be configurable).
4. (First time installation) Put your original game files into the target directory.
    1. For Steam and GOG users, extract the original `GAME.BIN` file using a tool such as UltraISO to your target directory.
       Note that neither the GOG nor the Steam releases ship the music files. You have a few options here:
       - You can download the music files from the link below.  
         https://tmp.sakuya.pl/tomb1main/music.zip
         The legality of this approach is disputable.
       - Rip the assets yourself from a physical PlayStation/SegaSaturn disk.

       Optionally you can also install the Unfinished Business expansion pack files.
       - Either this variant: https://tmp.sakuya.pl/tomb1main/unfinished_business.zip
       - Or the more manual link: https://archive.org/details/tomb-raider-i-unfinished-business-pc-eng-full-version_20201225
   2. For TombATI users this means copying the `data`, `fmv` and `music` directories.
5. To play the game, run `Tomb1Main.exe`.
6. To play the Unfinished Expansion pack, run `Tomb1Main.exe -gold`.

If you install everything correctly, your game directory should look more or
less like this (click to expand):

## Configuring

To configure Tomb1Main, run the `Tomb1Main_ConfigTool.exe` application. All the
configuration is explained in this tool. Alternatively, after running the game
at least once, you can edit `Tomb1Main.json5` manually in a text editor such
as Notepad.

## Q&A

1. **Is the game fully playable from beginning to the end?**

    Yes. If you encounter a bug, please file a ticket.

2. **Can we get HD textures? Reflections? Other visual updates?**

    Eventually, probably yes, but we'd really appreciate help with these.

3. **Can we get braid in every level? Skyboxes? Flyby cameras? New animations? etc.**

    The difficulty here is that these features often require inserting a
    completely new animation, a textured mesh or a sound file and pretend
    they're always been a part of the original game. So far we haven't found a
    good way that'll keep the code maintainable.

4. **Can I play this on Mac, Linux, Android...?**

    We'd like to eventually have only SDL dependency.
